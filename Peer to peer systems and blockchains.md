## Peer to peer systems and blockchains

---

### Lecture 1

Peer to peer started as a file sharing mean. Peers have a great "churn" problem, because of their on/off behaviour. A server is needed in order to bootstrap the P2P network. Peers are both providers and consumers. A peer to peer system is made of autonomous entities, it can auto-organise, and works in a complete or partial decentralized way. Another definition of P2P network focuses on its goal of sharing node resources, and being able to adapt to continuous churn.

**Blockchain**

It has various definitions:

1. A shared database stored in multiple copies on computers throughout the world, maintained without the need for a central authority
2. replicated and consistent, immutable, append only data storage system resistant to tampering
3. a write-only, decentralized, state machine that is maintained by untrusted actors, secured by economic incentive. You cannot delete data, nor shut down or censor the blockchain. It supports defined operations agreed upon by participants that may not know each other. The best interest for each actor involved is to play by the rules.
